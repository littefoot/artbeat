ROMEL 

Artist & Curator of ARTBEAT 

ROMEL is an artist whose work is shaped by travel, attention, and lived experience. 

With a connection to his Caribbean roots, what became his point of return — the Dominican  Republic, with its rich heritage, became the place that would come to define — Artbeat as a living archive and visual diary, shaped by belonging, and the quiet search for home, where the  colours of its people, revealed what art can do. 

Working across plains of photography, painting, and the tools of digital technology, Romel creates images that function as visual notes — moments observed and held long enough to be  felt. His work lives between structure and intuition, boldness and restraint, allowing form,  texture, and light to carry meaning without explanation. 

ROMEL stands behind the work — not to define meaning, but to protect the space where it can  exist. 

ARTBEAT — Artist’s Words. 

ROMEL 

“Each work in ARTBEAT is part of a living archive — a series of moments gathered over time.  The collection reflects years of travel between Canada, Europe, and the Dominican Republic. 

My work exists somewhere between photography, painting, and subtle digital intervention.  These layers are not aesthetic decisions alone — they mirror how memory forms: incomplete,  textured, and shaped by attention. Nothing here is rushed. Restraint is as deliberate as boldness. 

What connects the pieces is care. Care for form. Care for presence. Care for the quiet balance  between discipline and intuition. Each image is held long enough to arrive as itself, without  explanation or excess. 

ARTBEAT is not about trend or spectacle. It is about noticing — about allowing light, gesture,  and texture to do their work without interference. The result is a body of work that rewards  proximity and time – bold without breaking the vow of care, where structure and intuition surrender its control. 

As lovers of art, we are not acquiring a single image in isolation, but becoming part of an  ongoing record — a shared responsibility to protect the space the work creates.”
