# Tailwind CSS Architectural Standards

Trigger: Whenever the agent generates HTML, JSX, or Tailwind CSS classes.

Instruction Payload:

"Apply the 'Logical Grouping' protocol to all Tailwind CSS class strings. You must organize classes in the following strict sequence:

Layout & Positioning: (display, position, z-index, flex/grid config)

Box Model: (width/height, margin, padding)

Typography: (font-size, weight, alignment, color)

Visuals: (backgrounds, borders, shadows, opacity)

State Modifiers: (hover:, focus:, active:)

Responsive Breakpoints: (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)

Formatting Constraints:

Use standard Tailwind scale values; avoid arbitrary -[value] syntax unless explicitly instructed.

For components with >8 classes, prioritize the Official Tailwind Prettier sorting logic.

Add semantic HTML comments `` above every distinct UI block to ensure structural clarity."
