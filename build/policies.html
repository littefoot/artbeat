                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p><strong>📦 Free shipping in Canada for orders over $120 CAD.</strong><br>
                            If your online framed print or custom piece totals more than $120, delivery within Canada is
                            free.</p>

                        <p><strong>📦 Flat-rate shipping for smaller orders:</strong><br>
                            For orders under $120 CAD, there is a $10 flat shipping fee.</p>

                        <p><strong>🎨 Canvas Prints:</strong><br>
                            Most canvas prints are ready and shipped within about 3 business days. Shipping is free for
                            orders over $120 CAD, and $15 for orders under that threshold.</p>

                        <p><strong>📬 Tracking:</strong><br>
                            Once your custom framed or printed order is packed, we'll provide a tracking number so you
                            can follow delivery status.</p>

                        <p><strong>🕒 Production Time</strong><br>
                            Orders like custom framing usually take longer (often about 1–2 weeks depending on
                            complexity), with rush options available.</p>

                        <p>If you need specifics for a particular product (canvas, fine art prints, framed photo size,
                            rush timeline, or international shipping), please contact us.</p>

                        <p>Welcome to artbeat.ca. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound
                            by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before placing an order.</p>

                        <h3>1. Use of Website</h3>
                        <p>You may use this website for lawful purposes only. You agree not to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the site in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Intellectual Property</h3>
                        <p>All artwork, images, designs, logos, and content on this website are the intellectual
                            property of ARTBEAT and the artist Romel, unless otherwise stated. You may not reproduce,
                            distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any content without express written
                            permission.</p>
                        <p>Purchasing artwork grants you a personal, non-commercial licence to display the physical
                            piece. It does not transfer copyright or reproduction rights.</p>

                        <h3>3. Orders & Payment</h3>
                        <p>By placing an order, you agree to provide accurate and complete information. All prices are
                            listed in Canadian Dollars (CAD) unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to refuse or
                            cancel orders at our discretion, including in cases of pricing errors or suspected fraud.
                        </p>
                        <p>Payment is processed securely through Stripe. We do not store your full credit card
                            information on our servers.</p>

                        <h3>4. Product Descriptions</h3>
                        <p>We strive to display colours and details as accurately as possible. However, due to
                            variations in monitors and screens, actual colours may differ slightly from what you see
                            online. Slight variations in handmade or custom pieces are normal and add to their unique
                            character.</p>

                        <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                        <p>ARTBEAT shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
                            arising from your use of the website or purchase of products. Our total liability shall not
                            exceed the amount you paid for the product in question.</p>

                        <h3>6. Changes to Terms</h3>
                        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page
                            with an updated effective date. Continued use of the website after changes constitutes
                            acceptance of the new terms.</p>

                        <h3>7. Governing Law</h3>
                        <p>These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Any
                            disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Ontario.</p>
